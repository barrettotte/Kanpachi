# IBMi-Editor-API

Pet project: Making an editor API for IBMi. 
I have no hopes of this ever being usable by other people.


## Project Phases
1. Viewing source
2. Angular interface
3. VS Code Extension
4. Editing and compiling source




## Commands
* Run a test file ```python3 -m tests.test_xyz```


## Misc
* Fix "Error reading SSH protocol banner" in remote_server.py
